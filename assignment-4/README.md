# Assignment 4 documentation: Operating Systems

Before we begin with the actual documentation, I would like to rant a little bit about our use of the old, x86 version of xv6.\
Here is a note from the README file in the original repository:

```
NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)
```

Considering the RISC-V version is more well written, and actually compiles on modern versions of GCC, we believe it is quite a reasonable idea to switch to that version in the future.

Perhaps, if we feel advenurous, we might even re-implement the required syscalls and program in the RISC-V version. For funsies.
